#ArticleWritingChallenge
=======================

I have been thinking this of doing this for a while now finally I am challenging myself to write about atleast 30 posts in 30 days starting from 1st Sept 2014.

The idea here is to share / learn different technologies / libraries / frameworks that I wished to learn or have used in the past, even if not a full length blogspot atleast talk about it and show basic usage.

The focus is going to be majorily on :
* **Infra**
* **BigData**
* **DataAnalysis**
* **Scripting Utilities**
While the language which I'll be speaking is Python so it's going to be all the more fun.

**Topics**
-----------
* **Celery +Python**
* **Python + Pandas**
* **Storm  + Python**
* **Infra Monitoring Ecosystem with Python**
* **MRJob framework**
* **Jinja templates**
* **Parsing ApacheLogs**
* **Dashboards with Python + Splunk**
* **MapReduce patterns in Python / Jython**
* **Hive and Python**
* **Kafka**
* **Pig and data pipelines**
* **Ipython Notebook**
* **Conda : Packaging in Python**
* **Elastic Search**
* **Getting the best of Java  + Python using Jython**
* **Datawork Flows : Getting hands on with Oozie**
* **Joins in Hadoop : Programmatic approach**
* **A gist of hadoop properties and their basic usage**
* **Dumping data from Omniture into DB using it's API**

Excited and looking forward to it. :)
